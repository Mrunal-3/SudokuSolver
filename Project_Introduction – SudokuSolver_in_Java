## üìò Project Introduction ‚Äì **Sudoku Solver in Java**

### üîç What is Sudoku?

Sudoku is a popular logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The standard version is played on a 9√ó9 grid, divided into nine 3√ó3 subgrids. The objective is to fill the grid so that each row, each column, and each 3√ó3 subgrid contains all the digits from 1 to 9, without repetition.

### üéØ Objective of the Project

The main goal of this project is to **automate the process of solving Sudoku puzzles** using a **backtracking algorithm** in Java. The program reads an unsolved Sudoku board, processes it, and displays the solved version.

It demonstrates the use of **recursion, object-oriented programming, 2D array manipulation**, and **logical problem-solving techniques** in Java.

### üß± How the Project is Structured

The project is divided into two main Java classes:

#### 1. `Sudoku.java` ‚Äì Core Logic Class

* Contains the 9x9 board.
* Implements the **backtracking algorithm** to solve the puzzle.
* Contains utility methods to:

  * Check if placing a number is valid (`isValid`)
  * Find the next empty cell
  * Solve the puzzle recursively (`solveSudoku`)
  * Print the board (`printBoard`)

#### 2. `App.java` ‚Äì Entry Point

* Contains the `main()` method.
* Initializes the board with a sample puzzle.
* Calls the `solveSudoku` method.
* Displays the original and solved board.

### üß† Why This Project?

This project was chosen because Sudoku is:

* A **classic problem** that tests logic and constraint satisfaction.
* A **perfect application** of recursive backtracking in programming.
* Great for **practicing algorithms, data structures (2D arrays), and OOP**.

Solving Sudoku computationally also enhances:

* Understanding of control flow
* Debugging recursive functions
* Writing clean, modular code

### üß© Algorithm Used ‚Äì Backtracking

Backtracking is a form of recursion that tries all possible options and ‚Äúbacktracks‚Äù if it hits a dead-end.

In this Sudoku solver:

* The algorithm finds the next empty cell (value `0`).
* It tries placing numbers from 1 to 9.
* If the placement is valid, it proceeds recursively.
* If no number fits, it **backtracks**, resetting the cell to `0` and trying again.

This continues until:

* The board is completely filled with valid numbers, or
* It determines that the puzzle is unsolvable.

### üí¨ Use Cases

* Logic puzzle apps
* Game development backend
* Educational tools for algorithm visualization
* Interview prep for recursion and backtracking
